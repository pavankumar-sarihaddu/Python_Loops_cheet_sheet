Loops
So far we have seen that Python executes code in a sequence and each block of code is executed once.
Loops allow us to execute a block of code several times.
While Loop
Allows us to execute a block of code several times as long as the condition is True.

                     initialization
              -->    while termination_condition:
             |              block of code
             | ---          Updation
 
While Loop Example
The following code snippet prints the next three consecutive numbers after a given number.  
Code
a = int(input())  
counter = 0  
while counter < 3:  
    a = a + 1  
    print(a)  
    counter = counter + 1
